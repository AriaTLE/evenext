                The Mission <br /><br/>I want to start by saying this organization is not for sale. I don't care how much money you have
                I will just say no. My mission is to show people that there is a better way to treat people on this
                gorgeous home we call earth.<br/><br/>

                This is going to be a social network but first it is just gonna be Aria's = (Oneness through love and melody) feed.
                This is where we start. I am going to do some things in the world that no other human being that I know has the balls
                todo.

                The Game<br/><br/>
                I need coders, and no I am not open sourcing this yet, and for a reason.
                I am going to play a game w/ my tech buddies out there, and if you are a techie sleeping
                on the sidewalk, come play, please come play! I am going to hide my work phone number in
                the dom. Lets see where the smartest ones come from: the street or the penthouse. I will
                give one hint you are gonna really need to know ECMA Script to find me.
