                The Mission <br /><br/>My goal here is to take my emotion quotient coupled with my logic
                to fix the biggest problems that exist on our beautiful planet.  Why am I doing it on my own social network you might ask?
                Well I believe that the people on these boards at the companies like facebook, google and even our government
                have lost touch with the realities of life. They might be logically intelligent but that logic
                does not reach into empathy.<br/><br/>

                We have a man trying to figure out how to achieve putting people on an uninhabitable planet while people,
                their people lie on the street in pain. To me this is a level of ignorance and a display of a lack of
                any emotional intelligence at all.  We have human beings in jail for no reason other than trying to survive.
                Rather than having empathy for them and trying to help them survive we throw away the key.<br/><br/>


                Now this is not a religious venture but there is some logic in religion that I would like to put out their.
                In the bible it says that man can't judge man.  Now this makes complete sense to me because the people that
                judge live at a societal level that makes them incapable of judging. See to be a judge well chances are
                you didn't have to sleep on a sidewalk and if you did well no one would let you on a bench. But reality is
                in order to really be qualified to sit on that judicial bench you really should spend some time sleeping
                on a literal bench. If you haven't been through the school of life enough to be able to understand what you
                are judging then your judgment is not valid. This is to no fault of their own our society has just evolved
                in this direction naturally.<br /><br />

                I believe it is time for a change and I am going to be the one to start it, because I am extremely special
                but also because I am no more special than anyone else.  This is what I call perfect balance and I know
                it exists in me. Now the chances of me going to facebook, or x and getting a job even though I am a
                kick ass engineer is slim and even if I get the job how the hell would I work my way up to get them to change
                anything.  This is how these enterprise organizations work they are almost like their own living breathing
                entity. So instead Im going to build my own social network with the objective to help my friends
                who are getting arrested just for sleeping on a bench because society forgot about them.
                If you would like to invest time or money in what I am doing that is great but at no point will
                I give any percent of this company to anyone because I am not letting pride and greed tear down the
                vision I have.

                One last thing, a moment of silence for my two great children who our now dead because no one
                had the foresight to try to make it better.

                Oh and to Elon Musk and President trump keep working on that mars mission and soon you will know
                what it feels like to be locked in a cage on a planet with no one to help you.  Because Mars ain't
                got shit on planet earch.

                Sincerely,
                Aria Bowden ;)

                I am going to play a game w/ my tech buddies out there, and if you are a techie sleeping
                on the sidewalk, come play, please come play! I am going to hide my work phone number in
                the dom. Lets see where the smartest ones come from: the street or the penthouse. I will
                give one hint you are gonna really need to know ECMA Script to find me.
